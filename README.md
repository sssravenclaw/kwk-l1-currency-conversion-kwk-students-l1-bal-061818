## Today's Code Challenge!
### Currency Conversion
Congratulations, you just won a contest to travel the 
world!!! Before you embark
on your journey, you're obviously going to have to learn a 
little about spending
money in various countries because you can't use the 
United States Dollar
everywhere. In this challenge, you're going to build some 
conversion methods for
the top 5 used currencies in the world. Once you're done, 
you should be able to
apply what you learned to build a converter for any 
country you would like to
visit. Let your imagination run wild!

### Currency Conversion

Congratulations, you just won a contest to travel the world!!! Before you embark

### Challenge 1

Write two methods: one named `usd_to_eur` and one named `eur_to_usd`. The method
called `usd_to_eur` should take a dollar amount as an argument, and return the
equivalent value in Euros. The method `eur_to_usd` should do the reverse: it
should take an amount in Euros as an argument, and return the equivalent value
in US Dollars. Values of currencies fluctuate with the market, so you'll need to
do some research online to see their current market values.

To pass this challenge, it should be possible to convert dollars to euros, then
back to dollars and receive the same initial value. So, for example, if 1.20
dollars can be converted to 1 euro, converting 1 euro back to dollars should
return 1.20.

[Hereâ€™s a conversion tool by Google to help you with building your own conversion calculator.](https://www.google.com/search?q=USD+to+EUR)


### Challenge 2

Just like you did in **challenge 1**, build currency conversion methods for US
Dollars to the remaining three currencies (Yen, British Pound, Australian
Dollar). Don't forget to also build methods to convert those currencies to US
Dollars. After this challenge, you should have 6 more methods (8 in total if you
include the 2 from challenge 1).

* USD to JPY  
* USD to GBP  
* USD to AUD  
* JPY to USD
* GBP to USD
* AUD to USD

### Challenge 3

Build a menu that allows a user to input the amount of money they want to convert
and then select what type of currency conversion they want to use. A `puts`
should be used to display the converted currency value.

At the _bottom_, after the methods you've written in your ruby file, you're
going to copy and paste the code below. Don't worry if you don't get it at
first, just copy and paste it into your ruby file and run it, see if you can
figure out how this works by replacing `#code here` with something like `puts
"hello world`.   

```ruby
puts "How much money do you want to convert?"
amount = gets.chomp().to_i

puts "Pick from the following menu:"
puts "1. USD to EUR"
puts "2. USD to JPY"
puts "3. USD to GBP"
puts "4. USD to AUD"
puts "5. EUR to USD"
puts "6. JPY to USD"
puts "7. GBP to USD"
puts "8. AUD to USD"

choice = gets.chomp().to_i

case choice
when 1
  #code here
when 2
  #code here
when 3
  #code here
when 4
  #code here
when 5
  #code here
when 6
  #code here
when 7
  #code here
when 8
  #code here
else
  puts "Invalid input, exiting..."
end

```

You just used something called a switch-case without anyone having to teach it
to you! If you're curious about what else you can do with these, you can read
more about them [here.](http://ruby-doc.org/docs/keywords/1.9/Object.html#method-i-case)
